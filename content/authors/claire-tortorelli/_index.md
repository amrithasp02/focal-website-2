I use field, remote sensing, and modeling methods to investigate how vegetation responds to and influences disturbances, including drought and wildfire, at community and landscape-scales. I aim to develop co-produced, actionable science to inform management actions and promote balanced and resilient ecosystems. During my PhD at Oregon State University, I worked with managers to better understand the drivers and impacts of a recently introduced invasive annual grass, *Ventenata dubia*, in Oregon forests and rangelands. Currently, my research is focused on predicting the drivers of fire severity in areas that have experienced multiple fires and understanding long-term forest recovery following severe wildfire.
